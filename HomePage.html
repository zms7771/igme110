    <h1 id="bluehead">The Persona Series: The Influence of This JRPG Series on the Industry</h1>
    <img src="images/personas.png" alt="giraffe" border="4">
    <p>The Persona series is something I have cherished for years. Atlas started this game series way back on the PlayStation 1, with the original persona. 
        At the time the series wasn’t immensely popular, with it being only noticed in Japan. It was later localized and sent over to the west, but it didn’t sell as well as it does now. 
        Now the series didn’t pick up much till around the third title in the series. My experience with series and dates back to 2010 on my PSP and PS Vita. 
        A friend of mine recommended me a fun RPG game that not a whole lot of people knew about. Persona 3 was something I’ve never experienced before, a rich story and world, with intriguing characters, music, and an almost 100-hour long journey. 
        It changed me growing up, showing me the world of how video games can influence someone and how they can impact our lives overall.

    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
            At the beginning of the series, ATLUS started off the Persona series as a spinoff from their mainstay series, Shin Megami Tensei(Farokmanesh). 
            This dates back to 1994, where Shin Megami Tensei If was a sort of framework for the future games. 
            In similar lines it was akin to an adult version pokemon, capturing demons and using them in battles, as opposed to fantasy creatures(Sapach pg 1). 
            Even the SMT series had a large amount of “demons” to collect like Pokemon, As of 2013, “Pokemon has 718 collectible monster and SMT has 488 collectable creatures.”(Sapach pg 3). 
            This was the main draw to the series for most audiences, racking up high sales throughout the years. The only problem was that the gameplay looped and wasn’t as engaging as Pokemon, and the story was pretty bare bones and on the back burner. 
            The SMT series couldn’t stand up to a giant like Pokemon with its current structure.Then ATLUS made Shin Megami Tensei: Persona in 1996(Farokmanesh).
            This was the start of the Persona series as a whole. In this game, it opened up the basic premise for the continuing games in the franchise, where a group of high school students summon supernatural beings called “personas” and fight demons. 
            The idea of a “persona” of a person is that they are “spiritual expressions of their inner selves that manifest in the forms of mythological beasts and demons”(Harper). 
            Persona 2: Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment greatly expanded what the series had to offer, but the completely wild and new design choices alienated fans from the original SMT series.
