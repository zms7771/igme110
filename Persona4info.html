                Now fast forward to 2012 when Persona 4:Golden came out on the PS Vita of all things.
                 I heard through some ads and online subreddits about this release and my love of the franchise was starting to come back again. 
                 I bought it on release day and played it for two weeks straight. 
                 While the original Persona 4 was mixed cause of certain aspects fans weren’t used to and the story being less involved, Golden seemed to fix almost everything people had problems with. 
                 For me, this game really changed me growing up. I was going through a rough patch in my life around that time, with family problems and financial problems, on top of having little to no friends, I turned to video games to cope with it. 
                 But once I turned on my vita and crawled into my bed after school, I fell into this world of wonder. 
                 The story of the gang of kids solving a Scooby-doo like  murder mystery with magical “personas” defeating peoples “shadows”, jumping into TV’s and having characters defeat their inner selves and their doubts, the loveable cast of characters that I still remember clearly till this day, the beautiful soundtrack and the actual fun combat made the journey of this game wonderful. 
                 The game was abundant with symbolism, such as the reoccuring “persona” and “shadow” aspects from other games being symbolism for both the “conscious” and “unconscious” selves we as humans have(Pearson).
                  The impact this game had on the industry was now more than just a ripple in an ocean. 
                  People started to take notice of this small and niche JRPG series from a company called ATLUS. 
                  Persona was now huge in Japan, the series exploded over there and was now widely known. In the west it was growing surely but steadily, making its name heard. 
                   Now after the popularity of Persona 4, people wanted more from the series. While the popularity of Persona was growing, the current gaming climate was still all fps and MMOs. 
                   Call of Duty and World of Warcraft were huge in the west.The problem was people liked quick, short bursts of fun, rather than invest in a huge story of a game.
                    But then, in 2016-2017, things changed majorly for the series.
