        Once Persona 4 Golden hit shelves back in 2012, people wondered about the next time ATLUS would release a Persona game. 
        ATLUS then made and announcement back in 2013 that Persona 5 was coming to Playstation 3 in 2014(Moriarty). 
        Once 2014 came around, it was then announced that Persona 5 was to be delayed, and then again, a year later, was delayed for a second time. 
        Eventually, it was released in Japan in September of 2016. The hype and buzz of this game was huge in Japan, with people praising it left and right. 
        This is where the hype in the west started to form. Finally, it was released on the PS4 in April of 2017 in the west(McDonnell).

        Thus people in the west began to notice it, and praise it for days on end. This relatively small fanbase and community now had expanded to the point where it was being considered the game of the year with other big competitors such as God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Mario Odyssey and even Breath of the Wild(Makuch). 
        The triple As of the year, the monsters behemoths that any kind of other game couldn’t conquer, was almost beat out by a relatively unknown developer in the west, ATLUS. In 2019, Persona 5  has sold over 2.4 million copies worldwide, a record number for the series and became a huge hit(Moore). 
        So what did Persona 5 do right that led it to be considered even competing with the top dogs? 
        Persona 5 was a once of a kind experience, for me, it's my favorite video game of all time. 
        Which is saying a lot, considering how many I’ve played through my life. 
        The art, music, design, characters, combat, story, were so well crafted and so well designed that I think it genuinely changed me.

         It made me feel something I’ve never felt about any other video game I played, it made me feel like I was apart of this fantastical story, rather than just playing another rpg. 
         The story of the rebellious teen fighting back against an unjust society and world with his friends who have been equally wronged, stealing the “treasures” from the corrupt adults to have them realize what they’ve done.
         On top of what the game improves, it also provides valuable symbolism that adds to the story. 
         That the heroes wear masks to protect their “inner vulnerabilities, and by literally “ripping off the mask” can they confront their “inner selves” and awaken their inner power and “help those in need”(Martinez).
         The overall style of gameplay, balancing the invading of palaces and the daily life of a high school student, hanging out with friends and studying was something that no other game in the series perfected so well. 
         It felt like the daily life and combat weren’t as well integrated as they should have been in other games compared to Persona 5. 
         The impact on me wasn’t just on me alone, it was felt on every one person who played this experience.
