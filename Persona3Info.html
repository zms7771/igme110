                    Persona 3 arrived in 2006(Farokmanesh). 
                    The game completely revamped itself into a fully-fledged immersive RPG with an abundance of mechanics and storytelling.  
                    In this entry, new features were added to add a sense of realism and roleplay to the world instead of just a turn-based combat simulator. 
                    Out of all of these, the most important to the series was the ability to build relationships with your teammates and surrounding people in your town/city(Diefenbach).
                    This allowed the player to build connections and feel immersed into the world with their friends and party members by getting to know them.

                    <br>
                    On top of this doing this social part of the game was essential to making your party stronger, building your bonds was important to increasing your strength as a team.
                     What Persona 3 did differently from other JRPGS was that it included two kinds of gameplay scenarios. 
                     One was being an everyday high school student, studying, hanging out with friends, building relationships, working, etc. 
                     The other is slaying demons in a nightmare fortress, progressing the story the farther you climb the tower.  
                    Now you would think that with such an amazing game and premise, with engaging story, the game would sell like crazy right and be super popular right? 
                    Both yes, and no. See, this series was only semi-popular in Japan, its presence in the west wasn’t widely known at the time back in the mid 2000’s. 
                    People in the west couldn’t even get a copy of the game because it wasn’t even localized till almost a full year and a half after the games original release date.

                    While Persona 3 was the kickoff for the franchise, it wasn’t its booming success just yet. 
                    But nonetheless the game sold very well for its time and finally made a name for itself in the market. 
                    ATLUS would go to make enhanced versions of the game, Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable, which both enhanced the game with more lore and story, with even Persona 3 FES allowing you to play a 20 hour bonus epilogue to the story.
                     The impact this game had was a small ripple on the videogame industry at the time, only a small stepping stone for what was to come. 
                     While we bided our time with the remasters and such, ATLUS got to work on another game.
